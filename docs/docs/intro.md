# Introduction

Here you will find all of my notes as well as code for LeetCode problems that I have solved.

## Why did I create this?
I had two issues while studying LeetCode style problems:
1. Lack of autocomplete and code snippets in the LeetCode editors
2. Making notes about how I solved the problems

To tackle these issues, I created this CLI (command-line interface) project. The CLI does two things: 
1. Create a dedicated environment for running and testing the problems in Rust
2. Create a docs page in this website where I can write down my notes.

For more information about how the CLI works, checkout the GitHub [README](https://github.com/ammar-ahmed22/lcdocs).
